      The dean and chapter are thereupon bound to elect the person so named by
      the crown within twelve days, in default of which the crown is empowered
      by the statute to nominate by letters patent such person as it may think
      fit, to the vacant bishopric. Upon the return of the election of the new
      bishop, the metropolitan is required by the crown to examine and to
      confirm the election, and the metropolitan's confirmation gives to the
      election its canonical completeness.
